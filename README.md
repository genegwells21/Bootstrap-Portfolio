 I was quite perplexed with the positioning of the side-bar. As I engaged in more intuitive and scrutinizing processes I found the ability to enable it to look aesthetically pleasing. I enjoyed the process of learning how to integrate a "panel panel-default." I learned how to create a panel body and also enjoyed learning how to experiment with bootstrap.
